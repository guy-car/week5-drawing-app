Nice to have:
toggle between move and draw should be different - after clicking move, button should say draw (already does) but bg should be black and text should be same green as Alien. This helps the user remember that they are in mode mode and can't draw.

Zooming out reveals the whole canvas (further zoom out)




Context / vibe:
- landing page with context

UI polish:
- maybe black background with default white stroke
- instead of clear (a symbol)

UX:
- animation until first stroke
- See about moving with two fingers without dedicated mode
- zoom with pinch three fingers

Alien behavior:
- aliens pick width and color

Feature:
- save to camera roll
- Emoji picker

Prompt:
- improve for alien theme

Post-processing:
- maybe?


___

there is an issue with the eraser. It looks grayed out by default. Clicking it makes the background black.
It's behavior should match the Palette and Pencil one. 
At first when there are no commands:
Buttons is light gray 














Branding somewhere

custom tools:
random path
point or circle to user's last drawing
