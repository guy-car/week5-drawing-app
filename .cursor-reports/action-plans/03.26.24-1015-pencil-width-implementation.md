# Pencil Width Implementation Action Plan - March 26, 2024

## Overall Goal
Implement a pencil width adjustment feature that allows users to modify their stroke width through a modal interface with a live preview, while maintaining the existing eraser functionality.

## Implementation Actions

1. **Update BottomToolbar Component State** (`components/BottomToolbar.tsx`)
   - Add state for stroke width modal visibility
   - Add state for current stroke width
   - Add ref for persisting stroke width between renders

2. **Create Width Adjustment Modal** (`components/BottomToolbar.tsx`)
   - Add modal component similar to color picker
   - Implement horizontal slider with range 2-48
   - Add preview circle above slider that updates with width value
   - Style modal container and backdrop

3. **Update Pencil Button Handler** (`components/BottomToolbar.tsx`)
   - Modify pencil button click handler to toggle modal
   - Ensure pencil button maintains inactive (grey) style
   - Update width state management to persist selected width

4. **Enhance Tool State Management** (`components/BottomToolbar.tsx`)
   - Maintain separation between eraser width (fixed 48px) and pencil width
   - Update tool change handler to properly switch between eraser and current pencil width
   - Ensure width persistence when switching between tools

5. **Style Updates** (`components/BottomToolbar.tsx`)
   - Add styles for width adjustment modal
   - Add styles for preview circle
   - Add styles for horizontal slider
   - Ensure consistent styling with color picker modal

6. **Type Updates** (`components/BottomToolbar.tsx`)
   - Update BottomToolbarProps interface if needed
   - Add any new type definitions for width-related state

## Success Criteria
- Users can adjust stroke width through a modal interface
- Width preview updates in real-time while adjusting
- Selected width persists until next adjustment
- Eraser maintains fixed 48px width
- Smooth transitions between tools
- Consistent UI/UX with existing color picker functionality

## Regression Risks and Safeguards

### Risk Areas
1. **Eraser Functionality**
   - Risk: Modifying width state management could affect eraser behavior
   - Safeguard: 
     - Keep eraser width in a separate constant
     - Test eraser-to-pencil and pencil-to-eraser transitions

2. **Color Picker Integration**
   - Risk: Modal management could interfere with color picker modal
   - Safeguard:
     - Ensure only one modal can be open at a time
     - Maintain separate state for each modal's visibility
     - Test interactions between color picker and width adjustment modals

3. **Tool State Management**
   - Risk: Width changes could reset tool selection
   - Safeguard:
     - Use separate state variables for tool selection and width
     - Test tool persistence during width adjustments

4. **Width Persistence**
   - Risk: Width could reset unexpectedly during tool switches
   - Safeguard:
     - Use ref for width storage instead of regular state
     - Test width persistence across multiple tool switches

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Tool Switching**
   - Switch from pencil to eraser and back - width should persist
   - Switch tools while width modal is open - should close modal and maintain last width
   - Rapid tool switching should not cause width resets

2. **Modal Interaction**
   - Opening width modal while color picker is open should close color picker
   - Clicking outside either modal should only close the active modal
   - Modal state should not affect current tool selection

3. **Width Behavior**
   - Slider should provide smooth width adjustment between 2-48px
   - Eraser should maintain 48px width
   - Width should persist after app reload

### Implementation Safeguards
1. Use TypeScript strict mode for width-related types
2. Add error boundaries around new modal components
3. Add comments explaining width state management for future maintenance
