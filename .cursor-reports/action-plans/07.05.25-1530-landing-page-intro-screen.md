# Goal
Introduce a simple alien-themed landing screen that shows a slow "Star-Wars" style text crawl on a black background. The screen appears **once** on app launch, and the user can scroll with a finger to accelerate. When the crawl finishes (or the user taps a **START DRAWING** button) the app navigates to the existing one-page drawing canvas.

# Action Plan
1. **Install & set up navigation**  
   • **Files:** `package.json`, *new* `AppNavigator.tsx`, `App.tsx`  
   • Add `@react-navigation/native`, `@react-navigation/stack`, and peer deps (`react-native-screens`, `react-native-safe-area-context`).  
   • Create a minimal Stack Navigator with two routes: `LandingScreen` (initial) and `DrawingCanvasScreen` (wraps the current `App` content).

2. **Create landing screen component**  
   • **File:** `src/screens/LandingScreen.tsx`  
   • Full-screen black `<View>` containing:  
     – A `ScrollView` (or an auto‐scrolling `Animated.ScrollView`) with the **full copy** provided below.  
     – An always-visible **[BEGIN TRANSMISSION]** button anchored at the bottom; onPress => `navigation.replace('Draw')`.  
   • Use styles: white/alien-green text, 24 px font, centered, large `lineHeight` for readability.

3. **Wire navigation into root**  
   • **File:** `App.tsx`  
   • Replace current JSX with `<NavigationContainer><StackNavigator ... /></NavigationContainer>`.  
   • Move existing drawing canvas UI into a new `DrawingCanvasScreen` component (or keep inline).

4. **(Optional) Add splash screen asset**  
   • **File:** `app.json`  
   • Under `expo.splash`, set a plain black background so the transition to the landing screen feels seamless.  
   • No extra work needed if default is acceptable.

5. **Copywriting**  
   • **File:** `src/screens/LandingScreen.tsx`  
   • Replace placeholder copy with the final text:  
```
FIRST CONTACT PROTOCOL INITIATED

Three days ago, Fractal Tech detected an unknown signal originating from beyond our solar system.

The transmission contained no audio, no text, no recognizable data patterns. Only visual elements—strange drawings that seem to respond to our own.

Our xenolinguistics team believes these entities communicate exclusively through visual art. They appear to be studying us, learning our patterns, reacting to our sketches with drawings of their own.

We don't know what they want. We don't know what their symbols mean. We don't know if they're friendly.

But they're waiting.

Your device has been selected for the experimental two-way visual communication protocol. Draw something. Anything. See how they respond.

Remember: Every mark you make is being transmitted across the void to an intelligence we cannot comprehend.

What will you show them about humanity?

   • Keep the copy in a string array for easy editing.

6. **Testing**  
   • Confirm navigation flow in the Expo Go app.  
   • Verify scroll acceleration and that pressing `START DRAWING` skips.

7. **Demo polish (if time remains)**  
   • Add a subtle starfield background (small SVG dots or Lottie).  
   • Fade-in/out the crawl (`Animated.opacity`).  
   • Add an alien chirp sound (`expo-av`) when transition occurs.

> **Estimated time:** 1–2 hours. Core flow (steps 1–3) ≈ 45 min; remaining polish ≈ 30–60 min.
