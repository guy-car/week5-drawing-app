# AI Drawing Commands Improvements (07-02-25)

## Original Request / Feature
Enhance the AI drawing capabilities by:
1. Expanding Skia command types (addRect, addOval, addArc, addRoundRect)
2. Updating the Drawing Canvas implementation
3. Enhancing prompt engineering
4. Refining command generation context

## Challenges
- Ensuring proper validation for new command types
- Maintaining coordinate system consistency (1000x1000 canvas)
- Balancing between creative freedom and structured output in prompts
- Handling multiple API calls in the context-aware analysis

## Successes
- Successfully implemented new geometric shape commands
- Enhanced the DrawingCanvas component to handle new commands
- Improved prompt engineering with better creative guidance
- Added context-aware analysis using existing drawing commands
- Maintained proper validation and error handling

## Methods Used That Worked
- Two-step API call approach (analysis then drawing)
- Context-aware command generation
- Expanded command palette with geometric shapes
- Style matching based on existing commands
- Detailed validation helpers for dimensions and angles

## Methods Used That Did Not Work
None to report as we're still in the implementation phase.

## Changes Made to Codebase

### 1. Types.ts Changes
```typescript
// Added new validation helpers
const validateDimension = (value: number): number => {
  if (value < 1 || value > BASE_CANVAS_SIZE) {
    return Math.max(1, Math.min(BASE_CANVAS_SIZE, value));
  }
  return value;
};

// Added new command types
interface AddRectCommand {
  type: 'addRect';
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

interface AddOvalCommand {
  type: 'addOval';
  x: number;
  y: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

// Similar interfaces for addArc and addRoundRect
```

### 2. DrawingCanvas.tsx Changes
Added new command handlers in the `addAIPath` function:
```typescript
switch (command.type) {
  case 'addRect':
    aiPath.addRect(rect);
    break;
  case 'addOval':
    aiPath.addOval(oval);
    break;
  case 'addArc':
    aiPath.addArc(arc);
    break;
  case 'addRoundRect':
    aiPath.addRoundRect(roundRect);
    break;
  // ... existing cases ...
}
```

### 3. Prompt Engineering Updates
- Enhanced the system prompt with expanded command palette
- Added artistic approach section
- Improved style matching guidance
- Added detailed examples for each command type

### 4. Command Generation Context
- Added analysis of existing drawing commands
- Implemented style matching based on user's patterns
- Enhanced coordinate system guidance
- Added scale and proportion matching

## Current Data Flow
When "AI Draw" is clicked:
1. `proceedWithAPICallHandler` is triggered
2. Canvas data is exported (image + commands)
3. `analyzeThenDrawWithContext` is called, which:
   - First API call: Analyzes image + existing commands
   - Second API call: Generates new commands based on analysis
4. New commands are validated and added to canvas

The current implementation uses the context-aware two-step analysis approach, which provides better understanding of user's drawing style and intentions.
