# Riff on User Sketches Implementation (07-02-25)

## Original Request
Implement a real-time AI-assisted drawing feature that can analyze and complement user sketches with additional strokes and shapes. The feature needed to:
1. Capture a lightweight representation of the canvas
2. Make a single streaming OpenAI request
3. Parse and animate responses in real-time
4. Complete first stroke in < 3 seconds

## Challenges
1. **Skia Image Resizing**: Initial attempts to use `scalePixels` and `scale` methods failed. Had to implement proper surface-based resizing.
2. **JSON Schema Generation**: Zod's `toJSON()` method wasn't available. Had to manually construct the JSON Schema.
3. **Stream Support Detection**: Needed to handle environments where streaming isn't supported (e.g., web browsers, corporate proxies).

## Successes
1. **Optimized Canvas Export**: Reduced payload size from 1-2MB to ~40kB using JPEG compression
2. **Vector Analysis**: Successfully implemented drawing analysis with:
   - Bounding box calculation
   - Average segment length
   - Dominant angles detection
   - Shape type histogram
3. **Real-time Animation**: Achieved smooth 25fps stroke animation
4. **Streaming Parser**: Built an efficient incremental JSON parser
5. **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation for non-streaming environments

## Methods That Didn't Work
1. `SkImage.scalePixels()` - Not available in current Skia version
2. `SkImage.scale()` - Method not found
3. `Zod.toJSON()` - Not implemented in current version
4. Direct SVG path manipulation - Caused coordinate system issues

## Methods That Worked
1. Surface-based image resizing with proper paint object
2. Manual JSON Schema construction
3. Stream support detection via feature testing
4. Incremental JSON parsing with depth tracking
5. RequestAnimationFrame for smooth stroke animation

## Changes to Codebase

### 1. New Files Created
- `src/utils/vectorSummary.ts` - Drawing analysis utilities
- `src/utils/streamJsonParser.ts` - Incremental JSON parser
- `src/api/openai/riffOnSketch.ts` - Main riff functionality
- `src/api/openai/prompts.ts` - Prompt templates

### 2. Modified Files
- `components/DrawingCanvas.tsx`:
  - Added exportCanvas with resize/format options
  - Added incremental AI command support
  - Added performance logging

- `src/api/openai/types.ts`:
  - Added RiffResponse types and schemas
  - Added JSON Schema definitions

### 3. Key Components

#### Vector Summary Interface
```typescript
interface VectorSummary {
  commandCount: number;
  bbox: { minX: number; minY: number; maxX: number; maxY: number };
  avgSegment: number;
  dominantAngles: number[];
  shapeHistogram: Record<string, number>;
}
```

#### Performance Logging
```typescript
const stamp = (label: string) => 
  console.timeStamp ? console.timeStamp(label) : console.log(label);
```

### 4. Documentation
- Added comprehensive README section
- Included sequence diagram for the riff feature
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Updated setup instructions with API key requirements

## Post-Implementation Fixes

### 1. OpenAI API Schema Compliance
- Fixed `response_format` in `riffOnSketch.ts` to properly wrap schema under `json_schema` key
- Added required `name` field to schema definition

### 2. Stream Parsing Robustness
- Enhanced SSE frame handling in `StreamJsonParser.ts`:
  - Added helper to strip `data:` prefixes
  - Properly filter `[DONE]` messages
  - Improved incremental analysis object capture
  - Added depth tracking for nested JSON structures

### 3. Memory Management
- Fixed Skia resource leaks in `DrawingCanvas.tsx`:
  - Added `surface.dispose()` after snapshot
  - Added `finalImage.dispose()` after encoding
  - Added null checks before disposal

### 4. App Integration
- Removed legacy imports from `App.tsx`
- Updated `exportCanvasWithCommands` type to include vector summary
- Switched AI Draw handler to use new streaming flow
- Added proper error handling and state management

## Next Steps
1. Run performance analysis with React Native tools
2. Fine-tune JPEG quality vs size tradeoff
3. Optimize animation timing for smoother experience
4. Add error recovery for failed API calls
