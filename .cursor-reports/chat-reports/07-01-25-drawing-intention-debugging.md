# Drawing Intention Debugging - July 1, 2025

## Original Request / Feature
The goal was to enhance the AI debugging capabilities by adding a "Test Coordinates" debug button. This feature aims to verify if the AI understands and can work with the coordinate system.

## Challenges
1. **Response Truncation**: The AI's response was being truncated, leading to incomplete JSON arrays.
2. **Floating Point Coordinates**: The AI returned floating point numbers for coordinates, which needed rounding.

## Successes
1. **Implemented Test Function**: Successfully added a function to test AI's understanding of coordinates.
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Added validation for coordinate ranges and response completeness.

## Methods That Did Not Work
1. **Assuming Complete Responses**: Initial attempts did not account for response truncation.

## Methods That Did Work
1. **Prompt Refinement**: Adjusted the prompt to request integer coordinates and limit the number of commands.
2. **Coordinate Validation**: Implemented checks for valid coordinate ranges and completeness.

## Codebase Changes

### App.tsx
1. **Added testCoordinates Function**:
   - Sends a prompt to the AI to draw a circle with specific coordinates.
   - Parses and validates the AI's response.

2. **Updated Prompt**:
   - Explicitly requests integer coordinates and provides a format example.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added checks for response completeness and coordinate validity.

## Next Steps
1. **Test Coordinate Understanding**: Use the new button to verify AI's coordinate handling.
2. **Iterate on Prompts**: Refine prompts based on AI feedback to improve clarity.
3. **Monitor Logs**: Ensure all responses are complete and valid.
