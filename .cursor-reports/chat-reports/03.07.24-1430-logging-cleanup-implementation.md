# Logging Cleanup Implementation (03.07.24)

## Original Request
Clean up verbose logging in the drawing app by:
- Removing excessive logging
- Setting up a debug flag system (DEBUG_STREAM=1)
- Showing only concise logging by default
- Updating tests to match the new logging system

## Challenges
1. TypeScript linter errors with error handling in App.tsx
2. Balancing between useful debug information and clean logs
3. Maintaining important status messages while reducing noise

## Successes
1. Successfully implemented a three-tier logging system:
   ```typescript
   export const streamLog = {
     debug: (...args: any[]) => {
       if (DEBUG_STREAM) console.log(...args);
     },
     info: (...args: any[]) => console.log(...args),
     warn: (...args: any[]) => console.warn(...args)
   };
   ```

2. Cleaned up verbose logging across multiple files:
   - riffOnSketch.ts
   - DrawingCanvas.tsx
   - App.tsx

3. Implemented environment-based debug control:
   - DEBUG_STREAM=1 for detailed logging
   - Default mode for concise logging

## Methods That Worked
1. Using a centralized logging utility in config.ts
2. Categorizing logs into debug/info/warn levels
3. Moving verbose command processing logs behind debug flag
4. Keeping essential status messages in info level

## Changes Made to Codebase

### 1. Config Changes
- Added DEBUG_STREAM environment variable check
- Created streamLog utility with three logging levels

### 2. Stream Parser Changes
- Removed verbose raw data logging
- Kept essential debug information behind flag
- Maintained important status messages
- Cleaned up duplicate tracking logs

### 3. DrawingCanvas Changes
- Removed redundant command logging
- Simplified success messages
- Moved debug information behind flag

### 4. Test Updates
- Added streamLog mock in tests
- Updated test expectations for new logging system
- Removed console spies in favor of streamLog mock

## Final Output Examples

With DEBUG_STREAM=0:
```
🎨 Starting AI analysis...
🎨 Using riff-on-sketch mode
✨ Stream finished with X total commands
```

With DEBUG_STREAM=1:
```
🎨 Starting AI analysis...
🎨 Using riff-on-sketch mode
🔄 Parser received chunk: {...}
📍 Processing AI command: moveTo
✨ Stream finished with X total commands
```

## Next Steps
1. Consider alternative error handling approaches in App.tsx to resolve linter warnings
2. Add documentation about DEBUG_STREAM flag in README
3. Consider adding log levels to environment configuration
