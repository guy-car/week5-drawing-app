# Drawing Intention Debugging - November 1, 2023

## Original Request / Feature
The goal was to enhance the AI debugging capabilities by adding a "Drawing Intention" debug button. This feature aims to help understand the AI's creative process and decision-making before generating drawing commands.

## Challenges
1. **API Communication**: Crafting a prompt that effectively elicits the AI's drawing intention without generating coordinates.
2. **State Management**: Managing the app's state to handle multiple debug modes.

## Successes
1. **Implemented Debug Function**: Successfully added a function to query the AI for its drawing intention.
2. **Enhanced UI**: Integrated a new button into the existing layout without disrupting the design.
3. **Improved Debugging Workflow**: Provided a clearer understanding of the AI's decision-making process.

## Methods That Did Not Work
1. **Prompt Misalignment**: Early prompts did not clearly separate intention from execution, leading to mixed responses.

## Methods That Did Work
1. **Refined Prompt**: Adjusted the prompt to focus solely on the AI's creative reasoning.
2. **UI Adjustments**: Modified button flex values and styles to ensure proper display.
3. **State Handling**: Used state management to toggle between different debug modes effectively.

## Codebase Changes

### App.tsx
1. **Added debugDrawingIntention Function**:
   - Queries the AI for its creative process and intention.
   - Displays the AI's reasoning in an alert.

2. **Updated Button Row**:
   - Added a new "Drawing Intention" button.
   - Adjusted styles and flex values for a 4-button layout.

3. **New Styles**:
   - Defined styles for the new button to match the existing UI theme.

## Next Steps
1. **Test Intention Analysis**: Use the new button to understand AI's creative decisions.
2. **Iterate on Prompts**: Refine prompts based on AI feedback to improve clarity.
3. **Monitor UI**: Ensure all buttons display correctly across different devices.

This implementation provides a deeper insight into the AI's creative process, helping to isolate issues in the drawing command generation pipeline.
