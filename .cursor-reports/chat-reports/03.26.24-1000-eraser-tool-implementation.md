# Eraser Tool Implementation Report - March 26, 2024

## Original Request
Implement an eraser tool in a React Native Skia drawing application that allows users to remove parts of their drawings while maintaining the canvas background and providing visual feedback of the eraser size.

## Challenges
1. **Stroke Width Handling**
   - Eraser stroke width wasn't being respected initially
   - Users were left with fat stroke width after switching back from eraser
   - Needed to maintain separate stroke widths for drawing and erasing

2. **Canvas Layer Management**
   - Initial implementation was removing canvas background color
   - Black paint appearing instead of erasing
   - Need to protect background while allowing stroke erasure

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Users needed to see eraser size before touching canvas
   - Required cursor preview implementation
   - Had to handle touch position tracking

## Successes
1. **Proper Erasing Mechanism**
   - Successfully implemented true erasing using Skia's `blendMode="clear"`
   - Protected background by using `<Group layer>` for strokes
   - Clean erasing without affecting canvas background

2. **Tool State Management**
   - Implemented clean toggling between draw/erase modes
   - Added proper stroke width persistence
   - Maintained separate stroke width memory for drawing and erasing

3. **User Experience**
   - Added visual cursor showing eraser size (semi-transparent circle)
   - Smooth transitions between tools
   - Intuitive erasing behavior

## Methods That Did Not Work
1. Background Color Painting
   ```typescript
   // Initially tried painting with background color
   paint: {
     color: backgroundColor,
     style: 'fill'
   }
   ```

2. Direct Canvas Manipulation
   ```typescript
   // Attempted direct canvas clearing
   canvas.clear(rect)
   ```

## Methods That Worked
1. Skia Blend Mode
   ```typescript
   // Successful erasing implementation
   paint: {
     blendMode: 'clear',
     strokeWidth: eraserWidth
   }
   ```

2. Layer Management
   ```typescript
   <Group layer>
     {/* Drawing strokes contained here */}
   </Group>
   ```

3. Cursor Preview
   ```typescript
   // Semi-transparent circle showing eraser size
   <Circle
     cx={cursorX}
     cy={cursorY}
     r={eraserWidth / 2}
     opacity={0.3}
   />
   ```

## Key Code Changes

### DrawingCanvas.tsx
- Added eraser state management
- Implemented cursor preview component
- Added layer management for strokes
- Implemented stroke width memory

### BottomToolbar.tsx
- Added eraser tool toggle
- Implemented tool state management
- Added stroke width controls

## Implementation Notes for Stroke Width
For the next agent implementing stroke width functionality:

1. **State Management Requirements**
   - Need separate state for drawing and eraser stroke widths
   - Must persist previous stroke width when switching tools
   - Consider using React context for global stroke width state

2. **UI Considerations**
   - Implement slider or buttons for width adjustment
   - Show visual preview of stroke width
   - Consider different width ranges for drawing vs erasing

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Update Skia path configuration with stroke width
   - Handle touch pressure if supported
   - Maintain smooth transitions between different widths

4. **Suggested Data Structure**
   ```typescript
   interface StrokeConfig {
     drawingWidth: number;
     eraserWidth: number;
     currentTool: 'draw' | 'erase';
     previousWidth: number;
   }
   ```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for adding stroke width controls while maintaining the existing eraser functionality.
