# Structured Output Refactor

## Original Request / Feature
The original request was to refactor the API call in `drawingCommands.ts` to ensure it aligns with OpenAI's structured output requirements using JSON schema.

## Challenges
- Encountered a 400 error due to potential issues with the `zodToJsonSchema` conversion.
- Syntax and linter errors in the TypeScript code, including missing commas and undefined variables.

## Successes
- Successfully refactored the API call to wrap the array of commands in an object with a "commands" property.
- Ensured the JSON schema is set to strict mode to enforce adherence to the defined structure.

## Methods Used That Did Not Work
- Initial attempts to refactor without wrapping the array in an object led to continued errors.

## Methods Used That Did Work
- Wrapping the array in an object with a "commands" property.
- Setting the JSON schema to strict mode.
- Correcting syntax errors and ensuring all variables are defined and used correctly.

## Description of Changes Made to the Codebase
- Refactored the API call in `drawingCommands.ts` to wrap the array of commands in an object with a "commands" property.
- Set the JSON schema to strict mode.
- Fixed syntax errors and ensured all variables are correctly defined and used.
