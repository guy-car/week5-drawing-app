# AI Prompt Experimentation Framework - July 2, 2025

## Original Request / Feature We Were Trying to Implement

The goal was to create a systematic way to test different levels of AI creative agency in drawing commands. Building on previous AI prompt optimization debugging work, we wanted to develop a framework that allows easy calibration of AI creativity levels - from restrictive "simple additions" to more permissive "artistic freedom" - to find optimal sweet spots for the turn-based drawing application.

The specific request was to create multiple experimental prompts with varying levels of permissiveness that could be easily tested and compared to dial in the AI's capacity to respond with appropriate creative agency.

## Challenges

### 1. **Balancing Simplicity vs. Functionality**
- **Initial Approach**: User first suggested creating 4 separate .ts files (experiment-1.ts through experiment-4.ts) with corresponding UI buttons and API routes
- **Complexity Issue**: This would require significant UI changes, new API endpoints, and complex routing logic
- **User Preference**: Midstream pivot to a simpler approach for rapid testing

### 2. **Creative Agency Calibration**
- **Challenge**: Determining the right spectrum of AI creative freedom
- **Consideration**: Need to maintain technical constraints (canvas bounds, valid commands) while varying creative permissions
- **Balance**: Finding sweet spots between minimal "v" shapes and overly complex additions

### 3. **Developer Experience Optimization**
- **Challenge**: Creating a testing framework that enables rapid iteration
- **Requirement**: Easy copy/paste mechanism for quick prompt swapping
- **Goal**: Minimize friction in the experimentation process

## Successes

### ✅ **Simplified Experimentation Framework**
Successfully pivoted to a more elegant solution using a single `experiments.ts` file with exportable prompt variables, enabling rapid testing without complex infrastructure changes.

### ✅ **Structured Creative Progression** 
Developed a well-defined 4-level progression of AI creative agency:
1. **Level 1**: Slightly more permissive (3-15 commands)
2. **Level 2**: Moderate permission (5-25 commands) 
3. **Level 3**: Guided creativity (8-40 commands)
4. **Level 4**: Contextual freedom (10-60 commands)

### ✅ **Developer-Friendly Implementation**
Created a system that requires only copy/paste operations to test different prompt levels, significantly reducing testing friction.

### ✅ **Clear Documentation and Usage Guide**
Included comprehensive comments and quick reference guide for easy adoption and testing.

## Methods That Did Not Work

### ❌ **Over-Engineering the Solution**
- **Approach**: Initial plan for 4 separate files, 4 new API routes, and 4 new UI buttons
- **Why it failed**: Too complex for rapid experimentation needs
- **Learning**: Sometimes the simplest solution is the most effective for research and testing

### ❌ **Complex UI/Route Architecture**
- **Misconception**: Believed we needed separate infrastructure for each experiment
- **Reality**: Copy/paste approach is faster and more flexible for iterative testing

## Methods That Worked

### ✅ **Single File with Multiple Exports**
```typescript
// Successful approach: exportable prompt variables
export const expPrompt1 = `...slightly more permissive...`;
export const expPrompt2 = `...moderate permission...`;
export const expPrompt3 = `...guided creativity...`;
export const expPrompt4 = `...contextual freedom...`;
```

### ✅ **Progressive Creative Language Design**
- **Method**: Systematically removed restrictive language and added encouraging terms
- **Progression**: "ONE simple" → "one or two" → "thoughtful" → "artistic intention" → "artistic instincts"
- **Command Limits**: Gradual increase from 3-8 → 3-15 → 5-25 → 8-40 → 10-60 commands

### ✅ **Copy/Paste Testing Methodology**
- **Approach**: Direct variable substitution in existing `proceedWithAPICall.ts`
- **Benefit**: No infrastructure changes required, immediate testing capability
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify and test variations on the fly

## Description of Codebase Changes

### **Created New Experimentation File** (`src/api/openai/experiments.ts`)

```typescript
// Pseudocode for the experimentation framework
export const expPrompt1 = "Slightly more permissive prompt with 3-15 commands";
export const expPrompt2 = "Moderate permission prompt with 5-25 commands";  
export const expPrompt3 = "Guided creativity prompt with 8-40 commands";
export const expPrompt4 = "Contextual freedom prompt with 10-60 commands";

// Quick reference documentation
// Usage instructions for copy/paste testing
// Progressive creative language examples
```

### **Key Prompt Progression Implemented**
1. **expPrompt1**: Removes "ONE" constraint, allows "one or two complementary elements"
2. **expPrompt2**: Introduces "thoughtful addition" language, increases to 5-25 commands
3. **expPrompt3**: Adds "artistic intention" and "decorative elements" concepts, 8-40 commands
4. **expPrompt4**: Maximum freedom with "artistic instincts guide creation", 10-60 commands

### **Documentation and Developer Experience**
- **Usage Guide**: Clear instructions for copy/paste testing methodology
- **Quick Reference**: Summary of each prompt's characteristics and command limits
- **Comments**: Explanatory text for each experimentation level

## Testing Methodology Established

### **Rapid Iteration Process**
1. Copy desired prompt variable from `experiments.ts`
2. Paste into `proceedWithAPICall.ts` text field (lines 47-63)
3. Test using existing "AI" button in the application
4. Observe creative output and command complexity
5. Iterate with different prompt levels as needed

### **Evaluation Criteria**
- **Command Count**: Does the AI generate appropriate complexity?
- **Creative Quality**: Are additions meaningful and contextually appropriate?
- **Technical Compliance**: Do commands stay within canvas bounds and validation rules?
- **User Experience**: Does the output feel like appropriate "turn-based" drawing collaboration?

## Next Steps Validated

1. **✅ Framework Ready**: Experimentation system is complete and ready for testing
2. **Ready to Test**: Begin systematic testing of all 4 prompt levels with various drawings
3. **Data Collection**: Gather results on which levels produce optimal creative agency
4. **Fine-Tuning**: Potentially create hybrid prompts based on successful elements from testing
5. **Integration**: Apply lessons learned to optimize the main `proceedWithAPICall.ts` prompt

## Key Learning

The primary lesson learned was that **research and experimentation frameworks should prioritize speed and simplicity over architectural complexity**. When the goal is rapid iteration and testing, a simple copy/paste approach can be far more effective than building elaborate infrastructure. This enables faster insights and more agile development processes.

## Impact

This session successfully created a lightweight, developer-friendly framework for testing AI creative agency levels. The solution enables rapid experimentation to find optimal balance points between AI creativity and appropriateness for the turn-based drawing application, building on previous prompt optimization work to create a systematic approach to AI behavior calibration.
